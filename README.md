For the fourth task, I designed and implemented a front-end interface for an E-Learning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a multi-section webpage that simulates the layout of modern learning platforms like Coursera or Udemy. The UI includes features such as course browsing, progress tracking, and dynamic interactivity through scripting.

The structure of the platform is built using semantic HTML5, including major elements like <header>, <aside>, <main>, and multiple <section> tags to organize the content. The header contains the platform’s branding, navigation links, and a course search bar, allowing users to easily explore academic, skill-based, or blog content.

The layout uses CSS Flexbox to create a two-column structure: a sidebar on the left and the main content on the right. The sidebar includes menu items like "Courses", "Carts", "Sharing", and "Achievements", along with personalized lists such as "Favourites" and "You May Like" sections. Each element is styled to maintain visual clarity and consistency.

The main area begins with a welcome banner styled with a linear gradient background and personalized greeting. It is followed by an "On-going Courses" section that showcases various enrolled courses using styled course cards. Each card displays the course title, category, author name, and a <progress> bar that reflects the user’s completion percentage.

Next, the "Activity" section serves as a placeholder for a dashboard-style graph or performance visual, helping simulate the analytical part of a real educational platform. Then comes the "Recommended Courses" area which lists suggested courses with minimal, card-like containers. Each item includes course names, authors, and publication dates, styled to enhance readability and UI flow.

The CSS styling includes a mix of inline styles for component-specific visuals and an external stylesheet for general layout, spacing, and responsiveness. Rounded corners, hover effects, color accents, and clean typography give the interface a polished and modern feel. Media queries are included to maintain responsiveness across devices, ensuring the layout works well on mobile and tablet screens.

In addition to static HTML and CSS, I incorporated JavaScript (via a linked script.js) to manage small interactive elements. For example, JavaScript can be used for dynamic search filtering, collapsible menu behavior, or user interaction logging — helping the platform feel more real and interactive. Though the full implementation depends on the script file’s scope, its inclusion sets the foundation for advanced interactivity like course progress tracking and personalized suggestions.

This project taught me how to design modular and scalable UIs for larger web applications. It also helped reinforce best practices in combining HTML structure with reusable CSS styles and JavaScript behavior. The platform’s interface is designed to be easily expandable, ready for backend integration in future development.

Overall, this task enhanced my ability to design user-friendly dashboards, work with real-world layout scenarios, and simulate complex UI flows using frontend technologies. The result is a functional, well-structured, and visually balanced e-learning front-end that represents both creativity and coding discipline.
